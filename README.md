## Live Demo

JustSayin is still under development! We are gonna release this app by February 2024, but if you are interested, go ahead and clone/fork the repository.

1. Navigate into `frontend/` and run React Native frontend by

```bash
npm start
```

2. Navigate into `backend/` and run NodeJS backend by

```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Navigate into `frontend/ios` then open XCode using

```bash
open frontend.xcworkspace
```

After XCode finishes loading, run the keyboard shortcut `cmd + shift+ k (⌘⌃k)` this will clean the build folder.

Then run `cmd + r (⌘r)` to rebuild the project. This will run simulator, and you will see the app running! Make sure to add our widget on the homepage for the full experience!

## Frameworks and Tools

- **Frontend**: React Native and SwiftUI (for widgets)
